## Welcome to the testing site


Here you can see a demonstration of a very common chrome attack. Essentially, the user clicks a link (thinking it's genuine), which opens a webpage that has code embedded to forcefully allow notifications from said site. This causes non-stop notifications to be flooded on the user's desktop from Chrome. 


I decided to make this demo because it happened to me on my company-issue work computer. It's quite easy to undo the damage, the user just has to block the address maliciously added in Chrome settings for notifications. 



## Links

This link will take you to a webpage that asks Chrome permission to display notifications: <a href="proper-test.html" title="Proper Test">Proper Test</a>

This link will take you to a webpage that ignores user input and forces notifications: <a href="attack-test.html" title="Attack Test">Attack Test</a>
